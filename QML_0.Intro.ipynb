In the mean time, I have also developed some courses on what is called now Machine Learning. Ten, fifteen years ago Machine Learning was called Statistics. Then, the CSVs files started becoming huge, with millions of rows and hundreds, thousands of columns. Statistics became Big Data. \n","\n","Some statistics rules for selecting which column (variable) to use, like p-value became difficult to be explained to customers, specially executives, which need something that can be quickly learned, easily remembered and  effortlessly applied on a daily basis. \n","\n","P-value also started giving strange answers when used in these colossal tables (after all, if 5% of your data is a 100.000 rows with 100 columns, who knows what will appear in this subset of your data???). \n","\n","It was at this moment that somebody \"remembered\" that p-values had been developed originally with way much more simpler tables, tables in which you were forced to use all the rows and columns in the development of your model. In this context p-values were a way of estimating the other data that was \"out there\". But with tables made of millions of rows you could just separate 500.000 of them to be the \"world out there\", use the 4.500.000 to develop (train) your model and afterwards see (\"test\") what would happen in the real world when your model was put to work. Statistics that had became Big Data was now renamed also to Machine Learning.\n","\n","The algorithms were still being used to model simple phenomena. Phenomena that could be described with straight lines. Science, the scientific revolution started 500 years ago when a group of geniuses tried to apply simple rules to simple phenomena. It worked for quite a while (astonishing well), but the rule was always: simple phenomena that can be described preferably with straight lines, at most with a parabola. \n","\n","The world is incredibly complex, but nonetheless our minds are capable of dealing with all kinds of phenomena, be they describable by straight lines or not. And then somebody tried to apply a method of finding non linear patterns in the data called neural networks. Statistics, now mingled with computer science became Deep Learning.\n","\n","But all this has a cost. The cost of dealing with millions of rows, thousands of columns, to train, validade and test our models. And this cost is paid in the most precious commoditty that a human being can spend: TIME! Our computers are becoming overwhelmed by this combination of Big Data, Machine Learning and Deep Learning that has accomplished a lot of things but needs an ever increasing ammount of data to be processed.\n","\n","It was then that another technology appeared. A technology that is still in its infancy, but is promising us with a future when computers will be able to digest an unthinkable ammount of data in a matter of seconds, process it and tell us where the results are. This technology is called Quantum Computing.\n","\n","What is Quantum Computing and how it can be used in the Machine Learning way of finding the utmost complex patterns in mountains of data is the purpose of a field now called Quantum Machine Learning.\n","\n","This field blends together two of my mostly cherished areas of study: Computing and Physics (and of course, the possibility of making some money along the line, after all, bills doesn't stop arriving each month for us to have them paid...). And this group of Jupyter Notebooks is my attempt to make this area of study better know by as many people as possible. \n","\n","Quantum Machine Learning. This is the Holly Grail of my knowledge dreams. Understand this dream, make it available to others, is the objective of this and other Jupyter Notebooks that I will try writing in the near future.\n","\n","In this journey, Python will be our driver, and Qiskit our compass. The destiny: translating to the world of Quantum Computing the Machine Learning algorithms that have made us devise a future with Intelligent Machines at our disposal.\n","\n","Hope you enjoy the ride. It will be bumpy, sometimes frustating, but if we keep our focus and always remember why we are here, I promise you that there will be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow waiting for us. \n","\n","Happy Journey! And Let Quantum Machine Learning BE!"]}]}
