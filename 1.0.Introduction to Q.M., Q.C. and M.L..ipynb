Being able to mix positive and negative values, we can obtain as a result for a combination of different $c_i$s even the value 0. This means that the state $x_i$ associated with the amplitude $c_i$ will have probability 0% of being measured, which means that we are not going to measure it. Therefore, we say that that result \"disappeared\" from our measurements, in other words, in that situation the particle \"disappeared\". Given that such a sum with a null result can only appear as a result of the interaction of other states, we say that a phenomenon of **interference** of the particle has occurred.

For our part, what interests us is that the superposition and its consequences can be easily analyzed through the machinery of complex numbers and linear algebra. Here we will follow the *philosophical* line very well described by a phrase uttered by the physicist David Mermin. It is said that one of his students started asking the so called unanswered questions about the nature of the quantum world. Every professor of Quantum Mechanics has become accustomed to answering such questions with an enigmatic smile. But in this case, Mermin just said: *Shut Up and Calculate*.\n",
